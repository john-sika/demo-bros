export const generalFaqs = [
  { q: "Are you licensed and insured?", a: "Yes. Demo Bros is registered with the Victorian Building Authority (VBA), carries $20M public liability insurance and full workers compensation coverage. Certificates are supplied with every quote." },
  { q: "How quickly can you provide a quote?", a: "Most quotes are delivered within 24 hours of a site inspection. For straightforward strip outs, we can often quote from photos and plans the same day." },
  { q: "Do you handle asbestos?", a: "We arrange licensed asbestos testing on every pre-1990 property and coordinate licensed removal where required, before any demolition begins." },
  { q: "What happens to the waste?", a: "We run recycling-first waste streams — concrete, brick, metal and timber are separated and diverted. We recycle and divert as much material as possible on every project." },
  { q: "Will you protect the parts of my property that stay?", a: "Always. Floor protection, dust barriers, service location and daily clean-ups are standard on every project, not optional extras." },
  { q: "Do you work after hours?", a: "Yes. Most commercial strip outs and defits run after-hours or over weekends. Residential work is scheduled to suit your household." },
  { q: "Which areas do you service?", a: "We service Melbourne and surrounds — from the CBD out to roughly a 30km radius across the inner north, inner east, bayside and west. If you're nearby, ask; we travel for the right project." },
  { q: "Do you provide fixed-price quotes?", a: "Yes. After inspection, our quotes are fixed — no day-rate creep, no surprise variations for anything within the agreed scope." },
  { q: "Do I need a permit for demolition?", a: "Full demolition and some partial demolition require a permit, and often an asset-protection permit from council. Interior strip outs usually don't — though removing a load-bearing wall needs engineering. We advise on your job and coordinate the demolition permit as part of the service." },
  { q: "How much does demolition cost in Melbourne?", a: "It depends on the job — a kitchen strip out, an office defit and a full house demolition are very different scopes. We provide a fixed quote after a site inspection so you know the exact price up front, with no day-rate surprises." },
  { q: "How long does a strip out or house demolition take?", a: "Most single-room strip outs are a one-day job; a whole-home or commercial interior typically runs a few days. On site, a standard house demolition is usually a few days once permits and disconnections are done — we confirm the program in your quote." },
